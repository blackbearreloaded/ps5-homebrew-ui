# The app folder and the release ZIP

Every build creates and validates `dist/<TITLE_ID>/`, the complete title
folder. It is the only build output:

```bash
make app
```

On Windows, `./build.ps1` runs the same build through WSL.

Tagged GitHub Releases and every CI build attach a `.zip` containing that
folder and its `SHA256SUMS`, and nothing else. To install a release, extract
the ZIP and upload its `<TITLE_ID>/` folder to `/data/homebrew`; see
[Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md).

No filesystem image is built. The `.ffpkg` (UFS2) and `.ffpfsc` (compressed)
images of earlier versions are gone, with `make ffpkg`, `make ffpfsc`,
`make packages` and the `DEPLOY_FORMAT` variable. If an old
`<TITLE_ID>.ffpkg` or `<TITLE_ID>.ffpfsc` is still in `/data/homebrew`, delete
it before installing the folder (`make undeploy` removes it together with
the folder): a folder and an image with the same title ID must not both be in
the loader's scan paths.

This project does not create a signed retail PKG/FPKG container.
